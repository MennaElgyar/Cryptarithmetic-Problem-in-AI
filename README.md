# Cryptarithmetic-Problem-in-AI
This is an implementation of solving Cryptarithmetic puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

Cryptarithmetic puzzles are a type of mathematical puzzle where arithmetic equations are presented with letters representing unknown digits, and the solver is tasked with determining the numerical value of each letter to make the equation true. In these puzzles, each letter represents a unique digit, and each digit can only be represented by one letter.

The goal of the puzzle is to find the correct numerical value for each letter so that the equation is valid.
